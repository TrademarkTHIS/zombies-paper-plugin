# zombies-paper-plugin
Minecraft plugin that adds a goal to the pathfinding system of zombies to make them significantly more aware of their surroundings. 

Previously, the plugin was using the default targeting system of the Zombie entity type. This wasn't very good because they cannot target a location, only an entity (player). The goal for this plugin is to have zombies act like they actually heard a noise, not that they heard a noise and KNOW it was you. As of the latest update, that is _finally_ what they do. There are many small tweaks to be made, but the basics are finally done.

Until it's completely finished there will be no releases. If you wish to use the plugin, you'll have to build it for yourself or wait for it to be finished.
